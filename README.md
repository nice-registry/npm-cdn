# npm-cdn

A webservice that dishes out files from npm packages.

npm-cdn downloads tarballs from the npm registry and stores them on disk. First-time requests for a package are slow because the entire package tarball has to be fetched, but subsequent requests for files in the same package should be pretty fast.

**Caveat npmtor**: This is a proof of concept app. It works, but it's experimental. It's running on a single Heroku dyno so it won't scale. To become a real thing it will need to sit behind a CDN.

See also [npmcdn.com](https://npmcdn.com/), a very similar project.

## Usage

To access a file inside a published npm package, use the following pattern:

```
https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/{packageName}@{packageVersion}/{filePath}
```

Examples:

- [/dat@6.8.6/img/dat-website.png](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/dat@6.8.6/img/dat-website.png)
- [/express@4.10.4/package.json](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/express@4.10.4/package.json)
- [/zeke.sikelianos.com@1.0.0/assets/images/hands.png](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/zeke.sikelianos.com@1.0.0/assets/images/hands.png)

## Indexes

When a package is downloaded, index files are generated in HTML and JSON format.

- [/browserify@8.1.1](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/browserify@8.1.1) renders an HTML
page with links to all the files in the package.
- [/browserify@8.1.1/?json](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/browserify@8.1.1/?json) returns
a JSON array of all the files in the package. You can also set an `application/json`
Accept header in the request instead of using the `json` query param.

## Redirects

If you request a package without specifying a version, you'll be redirected to the
index for the latest version of the package:

- [/lodash](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/lodash) redirects to [/lodash@2.4.1](https://npm-cdn.herokuapp.com/lodash@2.4.1)
